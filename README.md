# Hostocare-App

## An application where you can search, compare and review Hospitals, Clinics, Medical stores etc.

We have been working  to create a proper platform in which the user can check and compare the availability of hospitals in their locality. 
Through the app and web interface, the user can compare the different hospitals, medical shops, Clinics  nearby and their specifications
such as  the availability of beds and doctors. The user can also check the medical qualifications of the doctor and 
the time in which the doctor is available in a particular hospital or clinic.
## The goal of our platform is to make healthcare accessible to all at their fingertips. 

### This Application will be available on different Platforms including Android App Store and iOS App Store as well as a Web Application for PC/Desktop & Mobiles. 
The website can be found at [this github repo](https://github.com/very-good-team/hostocare).
